# intro-rmarkdown
In this R Markdown file you will find the basic concepts to be able to write scientific manuscripts in R. It is mainly based on [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and some other document that I find useful. All credits deserves to the authors of the original documents.
